As many of you probably know, today marks my last working day at Accenture and I'm headed off to explore the next exciting chapter of my career. Leaving this team is one of the most daunting but equally heartening experiences I ever had in my life so far. A big shout out to all of you - it has been such a pleasure working with you amazing set of people and this would be a long-winded email if I start thanking each one of you by name. I always believed in \"People before work\" but Idistrict never made me feel like I am compromising on either of them. I'm beyond grateful for all the people I met, all the things I learnt, the challenging work I was assigned, the fun I had and the amount I have grown in the past four years.\n",
